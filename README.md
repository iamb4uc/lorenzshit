This project is not the actual representation of
this concept you can probably find a ton of other
perfect 1:1 representation of this project on some
youtube video or a blog. This is just my
interpretation and a little bit of fun. This is not
trying to copy the system but instead a way of
understanding both the math behind it while
learning rust at the same time.
